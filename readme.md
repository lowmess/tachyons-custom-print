# TACHYONS CUSTOM PRINT

Functional css for humans (and printers).

Quickly build and design new print layouts without writing css.

This is a fork of [Tachyons Custom](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-custom). It is meant to be used alongside it in a build system. It includes no variables of its own, it only inherits them from tachyons-custom.

Basically, this repo takes Tachyons Custom and adds a `-p` media query suffix.

## Install

```sh
yarn add tachyons-custom-print
```

## Use

```sh
@import 'tachyons-custom-print'
```

## Profit
